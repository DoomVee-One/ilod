# Imperial Library of Doom

This projects aims to provide an online Library API & Frontend for work teams
and students to use! That API will be capable of organizing and managing all
kinds of books! The Frontend will provide a user friendly way to interact with
the API and read or download the books from the server!  

Since there's not much, but a vision of the project at the moment this README
is pretty empty, but it's going to fill up over time introducing this project
and its state in a detailed and precise manner.
