# Imperial Library of Doom API

## Setup
<sub><i> 
    In order to guarantee a proper setup, make sure to checkout
    the <a href="../README.md#Setup">general setup instructions</a>.
    There you will set up a proper environment for the API to
    work in.

In order to set up the API, you only need to install its dependencies:
```shell
# inside ilod/ilod-api
pnpm i
```

## Launch
After the setup you can launch the API by typing:
```shell
pnpm start
```
This should start up the application and make the ILoD API available!  
Now the API Documentation should be available at the 
[/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs) endpoint.
